# Dedicated Environment Objects

Everything in this example is as it was in the previous, except we have now introduced a dedicated environment viewmodel
for faster development inside a particular environment (in our case, WordPress).

The only differences in this example are;

- The introduction of the `WordPress_View_Model` class
- The implementation changes on `index.php` and `page-template.php`
