# Code Examples

These code examples are designed to demonstrate the path we might take when making our UI components more modular. This
isn't necessarily the way things *should* be done, but it's the way I do it and it's keeping me sane. Feel free to 
change things up however you like to better suit your needs and your workflow.

**Note: These examples were prepared hastily, so be prepared for something to not work and irritate you. If you notice
something, post an issue and I'll sort it out when I get some time.**
