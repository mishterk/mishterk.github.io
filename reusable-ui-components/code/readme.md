# Code Examples

These code examples are designed to demonstrate the path we might take when making our UI components more modular. This
isn't necessarily the way things *should* be done, but it's the way I do it and it's keeping me sane. Keep in mind that 
these examples are here for conceptual learning and shouldn't be looked to as a complete and robust approach. Feel free 
to change things up however you like to better suit your needs and your workflow.

**Note: These examples were prepared on very short notice, so the WordPress may not be 100% accurate. If you notice 
something is amiss, have a cry into your beer so we can all laugh about it later. You're also welcome to post an issue 
so I can make the necessary adjustments.**
